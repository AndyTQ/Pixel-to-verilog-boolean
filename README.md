# Pixel_to_verilog_boolean
A very simple tool that converts bmp file to a verilog boolean expression. Supports monochrome only. 

Please replace the test.bmp file with the file you want to convert.
Make sure the file is in BMP format.
After the step above, simply run the html webpage. :)

This script DOES NOT support chrome unless if you turn off the security settings.
It is tested on Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer 11.
